      <h2>üìú about me </h2>

      <p>
        As a Software Engineer, my passion lies in creating applications that are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally sound. What started as a curiosity in August 2022 quickly blossomed into a full-blown passion for programming, leading me to pursue a degree from a top coding bootcamp and a career in the field. My goal is to continue learning and growing under the guidance of great mentors, eventually becoming one myself and sharing my knowledge with others.

      <p>
        I developed a full-stack UI clone of Airbnb's "item detail page" as part of a team of four using React, JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, Postgres, Docker, Git, npm, and Visual Studio Code. The project involved utilizing React's lifecycle methods and performing external API requests to replicate the functionality of the original page, as well as implementing various modules of related functionality to ensure the project looked identical to the original. Through collaborating with my team, I was able to replicate a natural work-like environment and improve my skills in teamwork and communication.

      <p>
        I revamped a client's website, Admission-hub, with improved functionality and security. The project involved implementing secure authentication and authorization for user accounts, as well as reorganizing the code architecture to improve readability and reduce technical debt. Additionally, I fixed bugs, streamlined data transfer, and updated UI elements to enhance the overall user experience. To ensure more efficient and reliable application performance, I automated testing using Pupeteer. The project challenged me to utilize my programming skills to deliver a high-quality product that met the client's needs.

      <p>
        ChronoBeats was a project where I designed and implemented a music database system that mimicked music consumption applications such as Spotify and iTunes. As part of this project, I conducted various types of testing on the database system using the k6 testing tool, including load, spike, soak, and stress testing, and compared the results between Postgres and MongoDB. Through research and testing, I determined that Postgres was the optimal database solution due to its 27% faster response time and lower failure rate during all test scenarios. To efficiently test different database solutions and architectures without interrupting production services, I also implemented modular and containerized components using Docker. Overall, this project allowed me to gain valuable experience in database design and testing, and I am proud of the efficient and effective solutions that I implemented.

      <h3>US Marine Corps</h3>
      <p>As a Team Manager in the US Marine Corps from 2019-2023, I managed a team of technical experts and served as head of training and project management in the United States and East Asia. In this role, I provided training and education to over 100 employees and dozens of clients on current technology best practices while simultaneously managing a team of 20 employees. I was promoted for my ability to grasp advanced technical knowledge and develop other employees to the same level of expertise, resulting in 75% of lower level employees being promoted to similar roles across the organization. I was also awarded for spearheading and developing training by using strong organizational skills and coordinating with team leads across departments, establishing a training program for the organization to provide ongoing training to both foreign and domestic employees. Through my leadership and training efforts, I was able to contribute to the success of the organization and develop future leaders within the team. </p>
